/**
 * [AggregatedIndex] is useful for "aggregated" navigation mode â€” a mode in
 * which we navigate through multiple indexed folders (roots). For a single-root
 * navigation [PlainIndex] can be used, and both [AggregatedIndex]
 * and [PlainIndex] should be transparently interchangeable, meaning that
 * both implementations support the same methods and they should not be used
 * otherwise as by [ResourceIndex] interface. Any component using [ResourceIndex]
 * should function in the same fashion independent on implementation of the index,
 * and only capability to look into multiple roots is gained by passing
 * [AggregatedIndex] into the component.
 *
 * @param shards A collection of individual [PlainIndex] to be aggregated.
